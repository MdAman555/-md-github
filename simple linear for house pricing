�� Predicting House Prices - Linear Regression Project (Highlights)
Objective: Build a predictive model to estimate house prices based on various features (like area, location, etc.).
Approach:
* Data cleaning and exploration.
* Feature selection and engineering.
* Applied Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression models.
Key Techniques:
* Correlation analysis to find impactful variables.
* Train-test split for model validation.
* Evaluation metrics: R² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Result:
* Developed a regression model that accurately predicts house prices.
* Achieved a high R² score, indicating good model performance.
* Tools Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
Impact:
Helps buyers and sellers make data-driven decisions.
Demonstrates real-world application of machine learning in the real estate industry.
